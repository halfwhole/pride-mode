* pride-mode

Add some pride to Emacs!

[[file:screenshot.png]]

Pride mode is a minor mode that indicates your position
in the current buffer through a rainbow flag in the modeline.
The flag should extend from left to right as you move in
the buffer from top to bottom.

You can scroll the buffer by clicking on the flag area.

** Customizations

- =pride-bar-length=: length of the pride-mode bar in 4px-wide units.
- =pride-minimum-window-width=: minimum width of the window, below
  which pride-mode will be disabled. This is important because on
  smaller windows, the bar can potentially push out more relevant
  information from the modeline.

** Notes

This version requires the use of XPM images, which should be supported
by default on most Emacs 23 installations.

** Credits

Code and idea are very much inspired by [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode][nyan-mode.el]], written by TeMPOraL.
